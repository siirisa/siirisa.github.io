          <h4>BATHWICK MEADOW</h4>
            <p>A fantastic field owned by the National Trust. On this field you can enjoy great sunset views with a glance of Bath from the top of one of its hills. As a student this field is a godsend, after an exhausting day in lectures there is nothing better than walking home by strolling along the soft grass. Dog lovers will be greatly pleased that so many citizens stroll through these fields with their furry friends. So you will be greeted by happy dogs more often than not. Another bonus point of this field? Cows. It depends on your preference, but if you're looking for an authentic countryside experience then head to this field in the chance of bumping into a jolly herd of cows. </p>

            <p>Quietness: 3/5</p>

          <h4>FIELD NEAR SHAM CASTLE</h4>
            <p>You can access the field next to Sham Castle by walking up to the University of Bath campus. You can then take two paths, through the golf course, which we don't recommend if you're not in the mood to dodge golf balls, or via North Road. For students this field is an ideal spot to bask in the sunlight for an hour or two in between lectures and it offers another great view of town when you reach the castle. <br /> Need a great idea for a day off? Go to the driving range for a few hours in the morning and then recover your energies with a picnic on this field. </p>

            <h4>CRESCENT LAWN</h4>
              <p>If you live in Bath you have heard about this majestic lawn that spreads out in its full glory in front of the Royal Crescent. Well, there is no better-kept grass than this. If you are in town and feel the need to breathe some fresh air, you want to play football with some friends, or just want to look at happy couples lay in the grass this is the place for you. Apart from using the Royal Crescent Lawn for recharging your batteries and enjoying nature there are many events not to be missed all year around in this space. In autumn you can enjoy the open air cinema, and sometimes you might catch a hot air balloon being filled up, just like we did. Lastly, as any Bath student knows this is the best spot in Bath to take photos, especially the ones before Summer Ball. So in June, whether you are a student or not, dress up, and head to the Crescent to take some fabulous snapshots.</p>
